### Proposal

The National Crime Records Bureau, Under the ministry of Home Affairs,  has been using comprehensive statistics to annually compile Crime In India since the british rule, which started in the 1600â€™s.  As of 2018 a total of 50 million identifiable crimes were registered nationwide, yielding a 1.3% annual increase in the crime registration. 

The dataset that I am performing this regression analysis on, comes from Kaggle, titled crimes In India. This dataset holds complete information about various aspects of crimes that have taken place in India in a 18 year span, from 2001 to 2018.
